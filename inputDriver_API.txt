====================================
Reading joystick settings (REG 0x05)
====================================

DRIVER 00, 1 TO %j[, %k]

Returns which joystick/keyboard settings are defined for left and right joystick ports.
First return value holds left joystick (Joystick 1) selection and the second one, the right joystick selection (Joystick 2). 

Joystick/Keyboard settings can be one of the following:

1 - Sinclair 2 (67890)
2 - Kempston 2
3 - Kempston 1
4 - Megadrive 1
5 - Cursor
6 - Megadrive 2
7 - Sinclair 1 (12345)

=====================================
Defining joystick settings (REG 0x05)
=====================================

DRIVER 00, x, y

Changes machine's REG 0x05 settings for left/right joystick ports.

where x means:

2 - left joystick port (Joystick 1)
3 - right joystick port (Joystick 2)

and y is one the listed joystick/keyboard settings:

1 - Sinclair 2 (67890)
2 - Kempston 2
3 - Kempston 1
4 - Megadrive 1
5 - Cursor
6 - Megadrive 2
7 - Sinclair 1 (12345)

===========================
Reading input from Joystick
===========================

Reads a joystick port considering joystick/keyboard selection currently in place.

DRIVER 00, x TO %j

where x can be:

4 - reads left joystick port (Joystick 1)
5 - reads right joystick port (Joystick 2)

Regardless the joystick selection, values returned by the driver are consistent and independent from the device interface, where each bit indicates a direction/button state.

Bit   Direction/Button
 0  -     RIGHT
 1  -     LEFT
 2  -     DOWN
 3  -      UP
 4  -     FIRE 1
 5  -     FIRE 2
 6  -     FIRE 3 (Megadrive only)
 7  -     START  (Megadrive only) 

A bit is set (1) when the corresponding direction/button is activated/pressed.

Note: When reading the left joystick port (Joystick 1), the driver also reads input from the custom keyboard mapping (which defaults to the QAOP standard).

============================
Changing the custom keyboard 
============================

There is a default custom keyboard which provides the very commom layout QAOP (with SPACE as FIRE 1 and M as FIRE 2).
It is possible to change these keyboard mappings to suit any preferences.

DRIVER 00, 6, x, y

where x can be:

0 - UP key
1 - DOWN key
2 - LEFT key
3 - RIGHT key
4 - FIRE 1 key
5 - FIRE 2 key

and y is the char code for the key to be mapped.

Note: Changes to custom keyboard mapping are in affect until the driver is uninstalled or the Next is rebooted.
